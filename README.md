## Features
1. This app presents a **start button** in the beggining to start the trivia and in the end to restart it when the user chooses to.
2. Questions get rendered by Javascript **without page reload**.
3. When the user answers correct, he gets a message, the correct answer starts **glowing** and after to seconds the next questions is showed.
4. When user answers wrong he loses one point on his final score.
5. There's a **animation**: the whole container div disappears to the left, a new questions is rendered and then the container appears from the right.
6. When the user answers all questions his **score** is showed. The number of questions answered right out of total questions.
## Running the project
The code is made so questions can be removed and new questions can be added.The app will render all questions.   

In the future the code could run questions randomly so the trivia changes everytime and could get questions from an API.
